) \\r\\nplaying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . \\r\\nthe first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . \\r\\nthen suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . \\r\\nthe audience expectation is that they will add up . \\r\\nbut he has given clues that are self-contradictory . \\r\\nlynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . \\r\\nin fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . \\r\\nthere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . \\r\\nmad magazine called it a poiuyt . \\r\\nother sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . \\r\\nlook at small portions of it and makes sense . \\r\\nlook at the whole figure and it does not . \\r\\nthis film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \\r\\n\",\n          \"unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . \\r\\nostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . \\r\\nmany scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . \\r\\nthe cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . \\r\\ndirector douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he \\\" couldn't care less about the truth \\\" but was more interested in capturing \\\" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . \\\" \\r\\ndespite violating nearly every rule of \\\" legitimate \\\" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . \\r\\nwhile it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . \\r\\nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . \\r\\nhe has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( \\\" it's about women not wanting to look like cows \\\" ) to mary tyler moore ( \\\" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country \\\" ) to style ( \\\" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs \\\" ) . \\r\\nunzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . \\r\\nit's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . \\r\\nthe designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \\r\\nin particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \\r\\non the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \\r\\na variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \\r\\nthere is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \\r\\nnevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \\r\\nwhile unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \\r\\noverall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \\r\\nwhen the designer declares that \\\" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , \\\" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

\\r\\n\",\n          \"it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast . \\r\\nsure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . \\r\\nbut nothing entirely groundbreaking . \\r\\nwith the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . \\r\\nit's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . \\r\\nthe plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . \\r\\nbut , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . \\r\\nfound by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . \\r\\nwe follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . \\r\\nof course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . \\r\\nin tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . \\r\\ngags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . \\r\\nmost of the characters are amusing without being forced . \\r\\nas tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . \\r\\nhere , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . \\r\\nof course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . \\r\\nthe thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . \\r\\ndirectors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel . \\r\\nas tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . \\r\\nyour eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment . \\r\\nthe subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . \\r\\nthere are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . \\r\\nthere is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here . \\r\\nsuffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . \\r\\nthe grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost . \\r\\ngoldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers . \\r\\nglenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . \\r\\nas the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton . \\r\\nit helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules . \\r\\na burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence . \\r\\nstill , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed . \\r\\ni never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth . \\r\\nparents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan . \\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

more limited types of parts for which they are suitable . \\r\\nas was amply evident after basic instinct , sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon . \\r\\nrejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type . \\r\\ngloria is her latest disaster . \\r\\nbabe ruth didn't quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity , and neither should stone reject what she does best . \\r\\njaneane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone's part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn't do garofalo's comedic roles . \\r\\ngloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind the picture . \\r\\nafter seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press . \\r\\nit is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . \\r\\nas the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement . \\r\\nshe's got a bad attitude and a big mouth . \\r\\nshe also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . \\r\\nan annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky . \\r\\njust before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria's ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice . \\r\\n \\\" be a man , \\\" his father lectures him sternly . \\r\\n \\\" don't trust nobody . \\r\\nnot no broads . \\r\\nnobody . \\\" \\r\\nmost of the film's leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements . \\r\\nadd in the movie's almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing , and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones . \\r\\nlumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting . \\r\\nthey stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse . \\r\\n ( \\\" say you're my baby , \\\" kevin coos demandingly . \\r\\n \\\" i'm not gonna , \\\" gloria pouts back . ) \\r\\nthe movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites . \\r\\nthe kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared , no matter how many people are after him with guns , trying to kill him . \\r\\nand in one key scene , the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied . \\r\\ngloria , who keeps saying how she hates kids , takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys . \\r\\nthink her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ? \\r\\nif you don't know the answer , you may be just the right viewer for this film . \\r\\nyou have to say this for stone : she can keep a straight face . \\r\\nwhen explaining life to a 7-year-old kid , she says with utter seriousness , \\\" you got a lot of love making to make ; you got a lot of boozing to do . \\\" \\r\\ngloria runs 1 : 48 . \\r\\nit is rated r for profanity , violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . \\r\\n\",\n          \"my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . \\r\\nwhat an auspicious beginning ! \\r\\nwelcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . \\r\\nfirestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies . \\r\\nas our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are \\\" smokejumpers . \\\" \\r\\nwe then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from \\\" cosmopolitan . \\\" \\r\\nhaving the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . \\r\\nwhen , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . \\r\\nwith the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . \\r\\nnot bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . \\r\\nmiraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . \\r\\nin a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . \\r\\nas it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face . \\r\\nour show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . \\r\\nin a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . \\r\\nthe manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . \\r\\nthis mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . \\r\\nthe chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . \\r\\nwill it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ? \\r\\nshe has only seconds to decide who will be saved . \\r\\nyes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . \\r\\nnot content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . \\r\\n ( \\\" hoods in the woods , \\\" is what the \\\" ground-pounders \\\" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) \\r\\nalong the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . \\r\\nmost of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . \\r\\nhe flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . \\r\\narguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . \\r\\nusing a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . \\r\\nwhen the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . \\r\\neditor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . \\r\\nthe ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . \\r\\nperhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , \\\" it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . \\\" \\r\\nfirestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . \\r\\nit is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . \\r\\n\",\n          \"this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . \\r\\n \\\" shine \\\" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty \\\" life \\\" ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and \\\" love and other catastrophes \\\" ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . \\r\\ni can't recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . \\r\\n \\\" shine \\\" was one bookend . \\r\\nstand by for the other one : \\\" dead heart \\\" . \\r\\n>from the opening credits the theme of division is established . \\r\\nthe cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . \\r\\nbryan | brown . \\r\\nin a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . \\r\\nthe local police officer has the task of enforcing \\\" white man's justice \\\" to the aboriginals . \\r\\nthese are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . \\r\\nnaturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is \\\" payback \\\" . \\r\\nan eye for an eye . \\r\\nrevenge . \\r\\nusually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient's thigh . \\r\\nbrown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . \\r\\nhe admits that he has to 'bend the rules' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal \\\" payback \\\" . \\r\\n ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . \\r\\nthe local priest - an aboriginal , but in the \\\" white fellas \\\" church - has a foot on either side of the line . \\r\\nhe is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . \\r\\nernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . \\r\\nhe is part churchman and part politician . \\r\\nhowever the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . \\r\\nwhilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . \\r\\nhe takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . \\r\\nshe appears to not know this . \\r\\ntony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . \\r\\nhe then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . \\r\\nthe community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it's payback time . \\r\\nthe fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . \\r\\neveryone is affected in the fall out . \\r\\nto say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . \\r\\nsuffice to say it's a rewarding experience . \\r\\nbryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . \\r\\nhis officer is real , human and therefore flawed . \\r\\nbrown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . \\r\\nit wasn't long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . \\r\\nthe wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it's vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . \\r\\nthe cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . \\r\\nat least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon 'invaders' : \\\" jedda \\\" , \\\" the chant of jimmie blacksmith \\\" and \\\" the last wave \\\" . \\r\\nin a year when the race 'debate' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as \\\" dead heart \\\" . \\r\\nthe aboriginal priest best sums this up . \\r\\nhe is asked to say if he is a \\\" black fella or white fella \\\" . \\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
